      description: BCFtools is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the
        Variant Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. All commands work
        transparently with both VCFs and BCFs, both uncompressed and BGZF-compressed.  Most
        commands accept VCF, bgzipped VCF and BCF with filetype detected automatically
        even when streaming from a pipe. Indexed VCF and BCF will work in all situations.
        Un-indexed VCF and BCF and streams will work in most, but not all situations.
